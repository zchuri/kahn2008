# Generate Hippocampal Regions of Interest from Kahn et al. (2008) using R and FSL

Scripts to generate Kahn2008 hippocampal regions of interest (ROIs) <https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00077.2008> using 'fslr' R package <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fslr>.
Here there is the script (kahn264.R) with the commands needed to create this atlas, but you can find here the outputs in MNI space coordinates in 1 and 2mm resolution. It is set to create spheres of 3 mm radious at the given MNI coordinates. The right ROIs were mirrored from the left ones. To run the entire script is necesary to have installed R and FSL.
Cheers :)
